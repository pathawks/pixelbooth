# Third-party notices

PixelBooth bundles a build-selected Core ML conversion of Depth Anything V2,
based on work by Lihe Yang and contributors. `DepthModel.json` in the app's
Resources identifies the actual model, source revision, file hashes and
license. The selected model's full license is included as
`DepthModel-LICENSE` in the app's ThirdPartyNotices directory.

The checked-in Small F16/F32 selections use Apple's Apache-2.0 conversion:
https://huggingface.co/apple/coreml-depth-anything-v2-small.
Local overrides supply their own pinned model and corresponding license;
the selected license governs that model's distribution and use.

PixelBooth statically links the following third-party libraries:
